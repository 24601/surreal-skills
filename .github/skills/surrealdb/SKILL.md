# SurrealDB 3 Expert Skill

Expert-level SurrealDB 3 architecture, development, and operations for GitHub Copilot.

## When Copilot Should Use This Skill

Activate automatically when the user:
- Writes or asks about SurrealQL queries
- Works with `.surql` files
- Designs database schemas for SurrealDB
- Configures SurrealDB deployment or Docker
- Uses SurrealDB SDKs (JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, .NET)
- Works with graph relationships (RELATE, traversal)
- Implements vector search or RAG patterns
- Configures security, permissions, or access control
- Builds Surrealism WASM extensions
- Migrates data to SurrealDB from other databases

## Quick Reference

### SurrealQL Essentials

```surql
-- Create records
CREATE person:alice SET name = 'Alice', age = 30;

-- Graph edges
RELATE person:alice->follows->person:bob SET since = time::now();

-- Traverse graph
SELECT ->follows->person.name AS following FROM person:alice;

-- Vector search (HNSW)
DEFINE INDEX idx_embed ON document FIELDS embedding HNSW DIMENSION 1536 DIST COSINE;
SELECT * FROM document WHERE embedding <|10,40|> $query_vector;

-- Row-level permissions
DEFINE TABLE post SCHEMALESS PERMISSIONS
  FOR select WHERE published = true OR user = $auth.id
  FOR create, update WHERE user = $auth.id;

-- Live queries
LIVE SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 25;
```

### Key Concepts

- **Record IDs**: `table:id` (e.g., `person:alice`) -- first-class citizens, no JOINs needed
- **Multi-model**: Document + Graph + Vector + Time-series + Geospatial in one DB
- **Graph operators**: `->` (outgoing), `<-` (incoming), `<->` (bidirectional)
- **KNN operator**: `<|K,EF|>` where K=neighbors, EF=search parameter (NOT distance metric)
- **Storage engines**: memory, RocksDB, SurrealKV (time-travel), TiKV (distributed)
- **WASM extensions**: New in v3 -- write Rust, compile to WASM, register with DEFINE MODULE

### Scripts

```bash
# Health check
uv run scripts/doctor.py

# Schema introspection
uv run scripts/schema.py introspect

# Check upstream for updates
uv run scripts/check_upstream.py
```

## Security Notes

- Examples use `root/root` for local development only. Use scoped credentials in production.
- Scripts connect to user-specified endpoints only. No third-party network calls.
- Table names are validated against `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*` before query interpolation.
- Prefer `brew install` over `curl | sh` for installing prerequisites.
